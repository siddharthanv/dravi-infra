      "<h3>What is Sale Deed in India?</h3><p>A sale deed is a legal document used in property transactions as evidence for sale and transfer of ownership of property in favour of the buyer from the seller. A sale deed, also known as the final deed or conveyance deed, is an instrument in writing which legally transfers the ownership rights of a property from one person to another in exchange of a price paid/consideration. It is made for the sale or purchase of land or any construction made on it. The person who transfers the property is known as the transferor or the seller while the person in whose name the property is transferred is called the transferee or the buyer. The document lays down the details of the parties, the final deal price of the property, the accepted mode of payment and the time for handing over the possession of the property along with the original documents. It also acts as proof that the buyer is the outright owner of the said property.</p><h3>How is a sale deed different from a sale agreement?</h3><p>A sale agreement of immovable property is different from the sale deed for the same property. In simple words, the sale agreement of a property is a contract stating that a sale of such property shall happen on the terms as agreed upon by the parties. It specifies the terms and conditions, under which the property (to be sold) will be transferred. So, a sale agreement basically, contains a promise to transfer a property in future, after compliance with specific terms and conditions. It does not develop or establish any rights or interest in the property for the prospective buyer.</p><h3>Things to keep in mind before executing a sale deed</h3><p>Before the execution of the sale deed, the buyer should ascertain that the title of the property is free of all encumbrances. Verification of the encumbrance status from the registrar's office is a must for the buyer purchasing the property. After ensuring that the property is free from encumbrances, the purchaser should also corroborate that all the statutory payments such as water/electricity bill, cess, property tax and maintenance charges have been cleared and no further dues or permission is pending for the transfer of property through a sale deed. Buyers of a property must take note that the sale deed is one of the most important documents which establishes the proof of ownership post the purchase is made. Hence, one must make it a point to acquire this document.</p>",

This implies that anyone who gets a leasehold land, will own it for 99 years, after which the ownership is given back to the landowner. The long-term leases control the transfer of land and its uses. This time span is seen as a safe interval choice, given that it will cover the lifespan of the lessee and will safeguard the ownership of the lessor.</p><h3>Is lease deed registration mandatory?</h3><p>According to the Registration Act, 1908, any property being leased for residential, commercial, cultivation, hereditary allowances, or fisheries purpose, should be registered, if they are being leased out for more than 11 months. The law is applicable to all states, (except Jammu and Kashmir).

      "<h3>What is Settlement Deed in India?</h3><p>Settlement deed in terms of immovable property like land/building, is a legal document wherein parties settle their differences or disputes. Legal Definition states Settlement is a disposition of property/properties – whether movable or immovable, as per the choice of the owner of the said property/properties. A settlement deed for it to be valid has to be brought down in writing and has to be registered. Usually the nature of disputes settled through a settlement deed are court cases, property division, payments settlement. A settlement deed between members of a family is a family settlement deed, and most often it is related to the division of property. Settlement deed is a legally enforceable document and has to be registered. Only those properties can be settled which have been self-acquired (properties inherited and received through family partition are also considered self-acquired properties).</p><h3>Parties to a Settlement Deed and what is conditional or absolute settlement?</h3><p>The party executing the settlement(executants) is called the Settlor and the claimant (beneficiary) is called the Settlee. A settlement deed can be conditional or unconditional (absolute). In case of conditional – the settlor can impose certain conditions which the Settlee has to observe/follow such as pay certain amount of money to the Settlor every month / every year and non-abiding of such a clause will invalidate the Settlement and The Settlor has option to Void(Revoke) the Settlement due to non-fulfilment of said condition. So a Settlor can insert a clause to this effect and enjoy the benefits and life interest for his/her lifetime along with their spouse. In case of unconditional/absolute settlement, the property gets transferred to the Settlee without any conditions and the Settlor cannot revoke the same.</p><h3>Consideration</h3><p>In case of sale, there is monetary exchange involved which is basically the consideration for the property bought. In case of gift, it is imperative that there is no consideration (no monetary exchange for the property) so gifted (only out of love and affection). In case of settlements, consideration is not as direct as in the case of sale. Love and affection can be considered as Consideration for property settled by a Settlor to a Settlee (Settlee may be a family member or even non-relative). Settlee can even be for Charitable or Religious Trust – wherein mental satisfaction is the Consideration, even marriage is consideration for a settlement.</p><h3>Registration of Settlement Deed</h3><p>In case of immovable asset like land/building for a settlement deed to be valid it has to registered. Along with the settlement deed the following have to be presented at the Concerned Sub-Registrar’s office – a few of the other documents required are the title document (parent document and Patta) in original, Encumbrance certificate of the property (till the date of the registration), ID proof, Aadhaar proof of the parties – this list is not exhaustive and varies on a case-to-case basis depending on the property settled and the conditions contained therein the settlement deed.</p><h3>Registration Fees to be paid in case of Settlement:</h3><p><h6>The settlement fee is as follows:</h6><ol><li>If Settlement is in favour of family member then the Stamp duty is 1% of the market value of the property subject to a maximum of Rs. 25000/- and the registration fee is also 1% of the market value of the property subject to a maximum of Rs.4000/-</li><li>However Settlement for other cases - then the Stamp duty is 7% of the market value of the property and the registration fee is 4% of the market value of the property. Note: The definition of family member varies from state to state in India – but usually – family member consists of mother, spouse, son, daughter, grand children, wife of pre-deceased son. In Tamilnadu – family member includes includes father, mother, husband, wife, son, daughter,brother,sister and grand child. The relationship should be traced from the owner of the property prior to transaction.</li></ol></p>",

It can be a moveable or immovable property that is gifted voluntarily, from the donor to the donee. A gift deed allows the property owner to gift the property to anyone and avoids any future dispute arising out of succession or inheritance claims. A registered gift deed is also evidence in itself and unlike in the case of a will, the transfer of property is instant and you will not be required to go to the court of law for its execution and hence, it also saves time.</p><h3>What gifts require a gift deed?</h3><p>A movable property, or immovable property, or an existing property that is transferable, can be gifted and require a gift deed. Having a gift deed registered, will help you avoid any litigation that comes up thereafter.</p><h3>How to draft a gift deed?</h3><p><h6>A gift deed must include the following details:</h6><ul><li>Place and date on which the deed is to be executed.</li><li>Relevant information regarding the donor and the donee, such as their names, address, relationship, date of birth and signatures.</li><li>Complete details about the property.</li><li>Two witnesses to bear testimony and their signatures. Thereafter, depending on the value determined by the state government, the gift deed must be printed on stamp paper after paying the required amount and the deed should be registered at the registrar or sub-registrar’s office.</li></ul></p><h3>Important clauses to mention in a gift deed</h3><p>Here are some important things that should be mentioned in the gift deed.</p><h6>There’s no money or force involved</h6><p>Make sure that you add this consideration clause to the gift deed. It must be indicated that there is no exchange of money and that the gift deed is made solely out of love and affection and not due to money or coercion.</p><h6>You are the owner of your property when you gift</h6><p>Only the owner can gift a property. If you are not the owner (title holder) of the property, you cannot gift it to someone else, even in anticipation</p><h6>Describe the property</h6><p>All information pertaining to the property, such as the structure, type of property, address, area, location, etc., must be mentioned.</p><h6>Relationship between the donor and the donee</h6><p>If the donor and donee are blood relatives, some state governments may offer a concession on stamp duty. Even otherwise, it is important to establish the relationship between the donor and donee.</p><h6>Mention liabilities</h6><p>If there are rights or liabilities attached to the gift, such as whether the donee can sell or lease the property, etc., such clauses should be mentioned.</p><h6>Delivery clause</h6><p>This mentions the expressed or implied action of delivery of possession of the property.</p><h6>Revocation of the gift</h6><p>The donor can also mention clearly if he/she wants a revocation clause to be adhered to the gift deed by the donee. Both, the donor and donee, must agree on this clause.</p><h3>Documents required to register a gift deed</h3><p>Documents required to register a gift deed</p><h3>Can I revoke a gift deed?</h3><p>After the property has been gifted, lawfully, it becomes the donee’s and cannot be revoked easily. However, according to Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, revoking of a gift may be allowed under certain circumstances:</p><ul><li>If the gift deed was made due to coercion or fraud.</li><li>If it is determined that the grounds were immoral, illegitimate or reprehensible.</li><li>If it was agreed upon from the beginning that the gift deed is revocable under certain circumstances. In such cases, even in the event of the death of the donor, his legal heirs can go ahead with the revocation.</li></ul><h3>Income tax on gift deed</h3><p>Gifts have to be declared in the Income Tax Returns (ITR). In 1998, the Gift Tax Act of 1958 was abolished, only to be reintroduced in 2004. Therefore, in case you have been gifted an immovable property, you will have to pay tax, if its stamp duty value exceeds Rs 50,000 and if the property is received without necessary consideration. For example, if the consideration is Rs 1.5 lakhs while the stamp duty was Rs 4 lakhs, the difference between the two exceeds Rs 50,000.</p><h3>Tax exemption for gift of property</h3><p>If the property has been received from any of the following, then, the above clause shall not apply and the donee will not be taxed:</p><ul><li>If received from relatives by an individual and from a member by a HUF.</li><li>If received on the occasion of the marriage of the individual.</li><li>If received under a will or by way of inheritance.</li><li>If received in contemplation of death of the payer or donor.</li><li>If received from a local authority (as defined in Explanation to Section 10(20) of the Income-tax Act).</li><li>If received from any fund, foundation, university, other educational institution, hospital or other medical institution, any trust or institution referred to in Section 10(23C).</li><li>If received from a trust or institution registered under Section 12AA.</li></ul>",

    name: "Partition Deed",
    image: "images/sample.png",
    content:
      "<h3>What is a partition deed?</h3><p>Joint ownership of a property by many people is quite common, especially if it is an immovable estate that is owned by a family. The need for partition arises, when the co-owners decide to go their own way, as the combined ownership over the property limits their rights. The legal instrument that is used to affect this change, is known as the deed of partition or partition deed in legal parlance. A partition deed is mostly used by families, to divide members’ shares in inherited properties. After the division, each member becomes the independent owner of his share in the property and is legally free to sell, rent or gift his asset, according to his will.</p><h3>When do you need a partition deed?</h3><p>Co-owners enjoy limited rights over a property, as their undivided shares leave a lot of scope for uncertainty. Even though all of these people are joint owners, they are not free to rent, sell or gift the property on their own accord, unless each party agrees to such a proposition. Basically, the consent of each co-owner is required to carry out any such transaction. The need for a partition deed arises, when it becomes important to create a clear division of shares in the property.</p><h3>How is property divided under a partition deed?</h3><p>If a property is being divided between two people who have invested in the purchase, the division is based on their respective contribution. If two siblings bought a property for, say Rs 1 crore and each contributed Rs 50 lakhs, the property will be divided equally between the two parties through a partition deed. If the ratio of their contribution is 60:40, the division would be in this manner. However, the law assumes each member to have an equal share in an undivided property, unless documentary proof stating otherwise is produced. In case of inherited property, co-owners would get their share in a property based on their treatment in the inheritance law governing their religion.</p><h3>Application of inheritance laws on deed of partition</h3><p>Partition of any property is subject to the laws of inheritance. This brings into picture inheritance laws governing property division among Hindus, Muslims and Christians. At the time of partition, the share of each member is determined, based on his entitlement under the applicable inheritance laws. In case of Hindus, provisions of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, will be applicable at the time of partition of an inherited estate.</p><h3>What happens to a property after a partition deed is executed?</h3><p>Once the partition deed comes into effect, each share in the property becomes an independent entity. Each divided share of the asset gets a new title. Also, members surrender their claim in the shares that have been allocated to the other members. For example, if Sid, Shyam and Dev divide a property through a partition deed, then,SID and Shyam would give up their right in the part that has been allocated to Dev. Similarly, Dev would give up his right in the shares allotted to Sid and Shyam. Apart from the common areas where easements rights are applicable, each one has an independent property within an estate, after its partition. This also provides them the right to deal with their share in a manner they like. After the partition, each party must also complete the property mutation process, to make the change legally valid.</p><h3>Registration and stamp duty on partition deed</h3><p>To attain legal validity, a partition deed must be registered with the sub-registrar of the area in which the immovable asset is located. This is mandatory under Section 17 of the Indian registration Act, 1908. This means that the parties involved in the partition, will have to pay stamp duty charges (under the provisions of the Indian stamp Act, 1899) and registration charge, to get the partition deed registered. For example, in Delhi, 2% of the value of the separated share of the property has to be paid as the stamp duty on a partition deed. The same rate is applicable on registration of partition deeds in Maharashtra, along with a 1% registration charge. (However, it is not mandatory for the co-owners to register the partition deed in the state.) The manner of calculation of stamp duty would be better explained through an example: Suppose a father, through partition, divides his estate worth Rs 5 crores into three parts, keeping 40% share with himself, while allocating 30% each to two of his sons. In this case, the stamp duty will be applicable on the 60% of the property value, i.e., Rs 3 crores. Supposing this property is located in Delhi and the applicable stamp duty levy is 2%, then, the brothers will have to pay Rs 6 lakhs, to register the partition deed.</p><h3>Is it compulsory to register a partition deed?</h3><p>In 2018, the Maharashtra government said that the process of partition of properties belonging to a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) and the receipt thereof by a coparcener, do not fall under the definition of ‘transfer’. Consequently, it is not compulsory to register such partition deeds. Note here that in case the partition has been affected through a partition deed, which has not been registered, the deed will not be admissible as a proof in a court of law.</p><h3>Difference between partition deed and partition suit</h3><p>Under the provisions of the law, a property would be divided, either by way of a partition deed or by a partition suit. The need to go for the second option arises, in case of a dispute or in cases where the co-owners do not mutually agree to the partition. In this case, a partition suit must be filed in an appropriate court of law. Before one can file a suit, they will have to issue a request to all the co-owners, demanding partition. In case the parties refuse to entertain your request, you are within your legal rights to move court over the matter. Under the Indian laws, the aggrieved party must approach the court within three years, from the date when the right to file a partition suit accrues. Both the instruments, however, serve the same purpose – they create and extinguish rights of co-owners in a jointly owned property.</p><h3>Word of caution</h3><p>The text of the partition deed must be such that it explicitly mentions each aspect of the division. Aside from the names of the parties concerned, the deed must have a clear mention of the date on which the partition is affected. In case there are any ambiguities in the language or any errors in the text, a partition deed could be challenged in the court of the law. Co-owners are thus advised to first reach an agreement and clearly set the terms and conditions of the partition. All aspects of the division must be considered by each party, so as to avoid any inconvenience in future. Once the partition deed document is prepared, all parties concerned must read it thoroughly, to ensure that there are no ambiguities and that it is error-free. Once the text is final, the deed must be drafted on a stamp paper and the parties involved must proceed with the registration.</p><h3>Treatment of verbal partition or family settlement under the law</h3><p>The text of the partition deed must be such that it explicitly mentions each aspect of the division. Aside from the names of the parties concerned, the deed must have a clear mention of the date on which the partition is affected. In case there are any ambiguities in the language or any errors in the text, a partition deed could be challenged in the court of the law.

Once the text is final, the deed must be drafted on a stamp paper and the parties involved must proceed with the registration.</p><h3>Income tax on partition deed</h3><p>Since no transfer has taken place as such through the partition, the beneficiaries are not liable to pay any capital gains tax after the division.</p>",

      "<h3>MODT Charges:</h3><p>Memorandum for the deposit of title deed or MODT is applicable for all home loan borrowers. It is essentially an undertaking given by you that you are depositing the title documents of the property with the bank at your own free will in return for a loan. For some banks, apart from the loan agreement, the undertaking needs to be registered and the government levies a stamp duty towards registration charges. Stamp duty charges vary from one state to the other, but on average, charges of 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent of the home loan amount apply. A MODT is a part of the State Government requirements and has to be registered in addition to the loan agreement and has to be registered at the Sub-Registrar Office. It is mandatory in a few states, but not in all states. The pledged property is endorsed at the Sub-Registrar office.</p><h3>All You Need to Know About MODT Charges E-Filing</h3><p>E-filing of notice of intimation in case of mortgage by way of deposit of title deed came into effect on April 1, 2013. E-filing means the online or electronic filing of notices of intimation of mortgage of the property specified in Section 89B of the Registration Act, 1908. These amendments have been carried out in order to safeguard the interests of banks and society. Earlier, the agreement/intimation relating to mortgage by the way of deposit of title deed was out of the public domain. Due to this, there was scope for fraudulent practices like availing loans from multiple banks on the same property or disposing of the property which is already mortgaged. Therefore, these amendments have been brought with the objective of preventing such frauds</p><h3>In case of mortgage by way of deposit of title deed done on April 1, 2013, and after:</h3><p><ul><li>If an agreement is executed or signed between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, it has to be compulsorily registered. The usual time limit for registration is four months from the date of execution.</li><li>If such an agreement is not executed, then the mortgagor has to file a notice of intimation of such a mortgage. This notice should be filed within 30 days from the date of the mortgage.</li><li>When an agreement is executed and registered according to clause (1), then filing of the notice of intimation is not required.</li><li>The non-registration of agreement / non-filing of notice of intimation may defeat the legality of the mortgage and cause injury to the interests of parties involved. Any person who fails to file such notice within the prescribed time limit shall be liable for punishment under section 89C of the Act.</li></ul></p><h3>Procedure for the Registration of Agreement</h3><p>The agreement may be registered with the sub-registrar’s office where the mortgaged property is situated. The procedure for the registration is the same as for the other documents.</p><h3>How to Cancel the MODT once the debts are cleared?</h3><p>Typically, it’s the duty of the bank or Housing Finance Company to cancel the MODT (Memorandum of Deposit of Title Deed) after the closure of the Home Loan. But most banks (mortgagee) in India thrust the duty onto the borrowers (mortgagor). So, when collecting documents from the bank after the settlement of your loan, do not take the MODT. Instead, insist on the bank to cancel the MODT and give you a “Deed of Receipt” executed by the mortgagee in favor of the mortgagor. However, if they do end up pushing it onto you, below are the guidelines on how to do the MODT Cancellation.</p><h3>The documents required are:</h3><p><ol><li>Original MODT.</li><li>NOC certificate.</li><li>Bank representative (Mortgagee – Executant) Office ID.</li><li>Aadhaar Card</li><li>Authorization Letter from the bank that the bank representative is the authorized person for executing the cancellation of MODT (if applicable)</li><li>PAN and Aadhar of Borrowers (Mortgagors – Claimant)</li><li>ID (preferably Aadhaar) for 2 Witnesses</li></ol></p><h3>Benefits of MODT</h3><p><ul></li>The stamp duty and other fees are as low as 0.1% of the home loan amount. In the case of registered mortgages, the cost is comparatively higher.</li><li>The title deed can be easily secured after making the payments.<li>No registration process is required when the property is handed over to you.</li></ul></p>",

      "<h1>Simple Mortage</h1><h3>What is Simple Mortage?</h3><p>According to Section 58 of this Act, Mortgage is defined as the transfer of an interest in a specific immovable property intended to secure the payment of money advanced or to be advanced in the form of a loan, a current or future debt, or the performance of an engagement giving rise to a pecuniary liability. In simpler terms, mortgage can be defined as the transfer of an immovable property by its owner to another person/entity for the purpose of securing a loan. The property acts as a security for repayment of the loan. This term is commonly associated with banks as they commonly keep immovable property as mortgage while extending a loan.</p><h3>Types of Mortgage</h3><p>The person who transfers his interest in immovable property is called the ‘mortgagor’ while the transferee is called the ‘mortgagee.’ The instrument through which a mortgage is effected is called a ‘mortgage-deed.’ There are six different types of Mortgage-deeds:</p><h3>Simple Mortgage:</h3><p>In this type of mortgage, the mortgagor personally commits to pay the mortgage money, with an explicit or implied agreement to forfeit the property he has mortgaged to the mortgagee in the event of his being unable to pay the loan amount as per the contract.</p><h3>Mortgage by Conditional Sale:</h3><p>In this type of mortgage, the mortgagor conditionally sells the mortgaged property based on the condition that if he defaults in payment of the mortgage money by a particular date, the sale becomes absolute. The alternate conditions on which the mortgage is made are with regards to the sale becoming void if the payment is made, or the transfer of the property to the seller on the payment being made.</p><h3>Usufructuary Mortgage:</h3><p>In such a mortgage, the mortgagor explicitly or implicitly delivers possession of the mortgaged property to the mortgagee. He also authorises the mortgagee to retain possession of the property until the mortgaged money is paid back as well as receive rents or profits that accrue from the property in lieu of interests towards the loan extended.</p><h3>English Mortgage:</h3><p>In this type of mortgage, the mortgagor while binding to pay the mortgage amount to the mortgagee by a certain date, facilitates the absolute transfer of the property to the mortgagee. However, this agreement is subject to the clause that the mortgagee will re-transfer the property back to the mortgagor on payment of the mortgage money.</p><h3>Mortgage by deposit of Title deeds:</h3><p>This type of mortgage is specific to mortgagors in specific cities like Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai, besides any other town that the State government has specified. In this type of mortgage, the mortgagor hands over the documents of title to the immovable property as security to the mortgagee, in which case the execution of the mortgage-deed is not mandatory. This type of mortgage is also known as equitable mortgage as per English law, and is commonly used by banks extending loans against mortgage of property.</p><h3>Anomalous Mortgage:</h3><p>This type of mortgage is an irregular mortgage that is not covered under any of the above categories. It includes a simple mortgage usufructuary as well as a mortgage usufructuary by conditional sale. In this type of mortgage, possession of property by the mortgagee may or may not be delivered.</p><h3>Registration of Mortgage:</h3><p>It is not mandatory that all types of mortgages should be registered. However, with regards to equitable mortgages which are created through deposit of title deeds, registration becomes mandatory. For all mortgages besides equitable mortgages, registration is necessary if the value of the loan secured is more than Rs 100.</p><h3>Right of Redemption:</h3><p>It denotes the right of the mortgagor to recover or redeem the property on payment of the loan amount. Since a mortgage involves the transfer of interest in immovable property from the mortgagor to the mortgagee, the interest has to be transferred back on repayment of the mortgage amount.</p>",

    content:
      "<h3>What is Release Deed in India?</h3><p>A deed of release refers to a legal document that eliminates a claim previously made on an asset. It helps with the documentation of release from a mandatory agreement. The deed may be included when a homeowner receives the title of a property from the lender upon satisfactory completion of mortgage payments. The goal of a deed of release is to release the parties from past obligations.</p><h3>How a Release Deed Works</h3><p>The majority of individuals buy their homes with the help of mortgages provided by a financial institution – such as central banks, internet banks, commercial banks. When a financial institution lends money to the borrower, it takes a legal claim against the house as collateral until the loan is completely paid off. Once the loan is paid off and all the terms of the mortgage are satisfied, a mortgage deed of release is created. Until then, the lender holds the title of the property and after the final payment is made, the title of the property is transferred to the borrower of the mortgage. The title is secured collateral for the life of the loan, reducing the default risk of the lender. The financial institution’s legal department creates the deed of release after the loan obligations have been satisfied. The deed of release reports that the loan has been paid in full under the contractual terms. It also declares that there has been a transfer of title for the property from the lender to the homeowner. After the creation of a deed of release and the transfer of the title, the homeowner is under no obligation to the lender. The borrower of a loan needs to prepare a deed of release with the same agency that recorded the mortgage to be sure that all mortgage obligations are removed.</p><h3>The Use of a Deed of Release</h3><p>A deed of release is used to end an agreement or dispute and to make sure that no party can continue with the dispute or agreement. For example, when a commercial dispute is resolved with another party, both parties will need to formulate a deed of release. Once a settlement is reached, it is important to draft a deed of release to ensure that the other party cannot issue legal proceedings against the other parties. Therefore, a deed of release provides conclusive evidence following the end of a dispute or agreement. However, a release deed can limit legal actions. Therefore, it is important to understand the rights given up by a party before signing a deed of release.</p><h3>Types of deeds of release:</h3><h6>The following are different types of deeds of release:</h6><p><ul><li>Ending a personal guarantee is a deed of release that allows an individual to end personal guarantee and personal liability. </li><li>An employee deed of release is part of the employment contract. It relates to the termination agreement, redundancy agreement, or is part of a settlement between an employee and employer.</li><li>Termination of a credit agreement or loan involves ending a mortgage or loan agreement.</li><li>Resolving a commercial dispute is often in relation with a deed of settlement</li></ul></p><h3>Features of a Deed of Release</h3><p>A common feature of a deed of release is a mutual release, which involves both parties agreeing to release each other from the following obligation:</p><p><ul><li>Demands.</li><li>Debts.</li><li>Future claims.</li><li>Other relevant actions On the other hand, a release deed may allow one party to be free from certain obligations or liabilities – such as a clause preventing that party’s future services or employment.</li></ul></p><h3>How to Sign a Deed of Release</h3><p><ul><li>A person who is not part of the deed of release must witness both parties’ signatures.</li><li>The deed of release is executed in line with the rules of the companies.</li><li>There must be enough copies for each party to sign.</li><li>Once the first party signs all copies of the deed of release, then the signed copies will be passed to the other party to sign. The deed may permit parties to sign by counterpart, which means parties can sign separate copies of an identical deed of release.</li><li>Keep copies of the deed of release in a safe place.</li></ul></p>",

    content:
      "<h3>What is Rental Agreement?</h3><p>A contract between a landlord and tenant, whereby the former gives the latter the right to occupy a home or residential premises for a certain period, is termed as a rental agreement. It is one of the most vital documents for both parties to avoid future disputes. At a time when tenancy disputes are growing by leaps and bounds, it is of the utmost importance to secure a property by drafting a thorough rent/lease agreement and further, registering the agreement at the nearest sub-registrar’s office. Registering a rental agreement makes it legally binding and safeguards the rights of both parties in case of future conflicts. A rental agreement can be verbal, written or implied. However, a written agreement serves as evidence and summarises the terms and conditions mutually-accepted by both parties. Once both the parties agree to the terms and conditions mentioned in the agreement, it cannot be altered without their mutual consent.</p><h3>Why should you register a rent agreement?</h3><p>A registered rental agreement is vital for a discord-free landlord-tenant relationship. Not only does it foster the relationship between the two parties but also protects their rights. Further, it informs others about the ownership of the property. The landlord/tenant should never settle for an oral agreement since it is not bound by law and therefore, should always insist on executing a written agreement. Another key benefit of registering a rental agreement is that it acts as legal evidence and can protect the landlord from any legal dispute in the future. When a deal involves a significant asset such as a residential property, the landlord needs a document that protects him/her legally in case of any dispute or opposition from the other party in the future.</p><h3>When to register a rent agreement?</h3><p>According to the Registration Act, 1908, applicable to all States, (except Jammu and Kashmir), a ‘lease’ includes all entities such as residential property, commercial property, undertaking leased for cultivation, hereditary allowances, fisheries, ferries, rights to ways, lights and any other benefit arising out of the land (excluding timber or crops cultivation). All these properties should be registered if they are leased out to a tenant for a period of more than 11 months. A rent agreement that lasts only or lesser than 11 months does not require registration. It is also prudent here to add that while it is not mandatory to register rent agreements having durations of lesser than a year, it is still advantageous and proactive. A large number of disputes regarding the legitimacy of 11-month rent agreements have taken place in various High Courts and the Supreme Court of India, where in some instances, 11-month agreements have been deemed as inadmissible in court. Therefore, future disputes are not worth the savings of stamp duty and registration cost by not getting a rent agreement registered.</p><h3>How to register the rent agreement?</h3><p>Visit the nearest sub-registrar’s office for registration. However, it is important to keep track of the time when the deed was created. The registration must be made at least four months before the date of deed expiration. After this, a fresh deed has to be created. This is applicable to all legal documents mandating registration barring a property will. To register the deed, both the parties - the tenant and the landlord. should be present along with two witnesses for attestation. If both the parties are not present at the same time, he/she must sign the Power of Attorney, granting attorney the rights of agreement closure.</p><h3>What are the documents required for rent agreement registration?</h3><p><ul><li>The original proof/evidence of ownership or title of the property.</li><li>Property documents such as Index II or tax receipt of the property to be leased.</li><li>Two photographs of each of the parties and one of each of the witnesses.</li><li>Copy of the address proof of both the parties and witnesses. Passport, Aadhar Card, Ration Card, Bank Passbook or Driving License; any of them can be submitted as the address proof.</li><li>Route map of the property leased out.</li></ul></p><h3>What are the registration charges?</h3><p>Registration charges vary per state. Stamp duty charges are also applicable. These too vary per State. For instance, in Delhi, stamp duty charges for a property rented out for a period of 5 years is 2 percent. Similarly, a 3 percent stamp duty is levied on properties leased out for more than 5 years but up to 10 years.</p><h3>In a nutshell</h3><p>Over the years, there has been a surge in the number of tenant-landlord disputes arising due to several reasons. No landlord/tenant would ever like to get trapped in a legal situation. Thus, to avoid any unwanted legal situated in future, it is essential to get the rent agreement registered before entering into a rental situation. There is a high probability that if you get your rental agreement registered with the local registrar, you can easily avoid unwanted legal situations.</p>",

      "<h3>What is WILL Deed?</h3><p>Will is an important legal document in which the testator mentions about the distribution of the assets. However, it is not mandatory in India under section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 (Act), and according to section 18 (e). There is no stamp duty payable on Will registration. When a person makes a will, he/ she is declaring how the assets and properties are disbursed and to whom after his/ her death. Of course, the property and assets can’t be ancestral, but only self-owned. Registration of will is not mandatory, as under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, it’s considered to be a personal choice of the testator. However, it’s advisable to register it, if its contents are to be abided by after the person’s death. In other words, the will’s validity or genuineness will be a suspect and difficult to prove if it’s not registered.</p><h3>What are the conditions to be satisfied while drafting a will?</h3><p>The following conditions must be satisfied while drafting a will or make a will India-</p><p><ul><li>The first condition for making a valid will format is that it must be in written form. The law also requires the words in the will to be clear and intelligible.</li><li>As per section 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925, the creator (testator) of the will format must sign/affix his or her mark on the will.</li><li>The signature /mark of the creator ( or the signee on his behalf) must be placed in such a way so that it discloses clear intention of the creator to give effect to what is written in the will.</li><li>Section 63 also specifies that 2 or more witnesses should attest to the will. They must have seen the testator (or his authorized signatory) sign/ affix his or her mark on the will. But, a beneficiary of the will should not be included among the witnesses.</li></ul></p><h3>Procedure for will registration</h3><p>Having understood this, let’s look at the procedure for registering a will.</p><p><ul><li>Registration of the will happens at the office of the sub-registrar. One must submit address proof, photographs and the witnesses to sign the will. The witnesses have to bring their photographs and address proofs as well.</li><li>Once the will is drafted, a witness should accompany the testator to the registrar for registration.</li><li>Once it’s registered, it can be kept in safe custody with the lawyer or in a bank locker. In addition, the registrars have the authority to keep wills in the deposit. If you select a registrar to safeguard your will, you must apply the will in a sealed cover. After confirming the identity of the testator or the authorized person, the register will keep on the will.</li><li>If you want to withdraw the will from the registrar, you can personally send your request or do it through an authorized agent. If the registrar is satisfied, they will be delivered to the person.</li><li>In case you want to revise or modify certain clauses in your will, it can be done through Codicil, a document enlisting the amended parts of the will. It is then attested by the testator in the presence of two witnesses and kept along with the will with the registrar.</li><li>If the person whose will is with the Registrar dies, any person may apply to the Registrar for the opening of the cover containing that will. However, the registrar will only open the cover after confirming that the testator is dead. They open the cover in the applicant’s presence and also provide a copy of the will to them. The original will remain in the Registrar’s custody until a court orders them to produce the original will.</li></ul></p><h3>Advantages of Registering a Will</h3><p><ol><li>The will cannot be tampered, destroyed, lost or stolen.</li><li>The will is kept in safe custody by the registrar.</li><li>No person can access or examine the will without the express permission in writing of the testator until his/ her death.</li><li>If a registered will is uncontested, it may be possible to get the leasehold property mutated in the name of the legal heirs without obtaining a probate of the will.</li></ol></p><h3><p>Disadvantages of Registering a Will</p></h3><p><ol><li>Revocation of a registered will is cumbersome when compared to the revocation of an unregistered will.</li><li>If a registered will is revoked, the subsequent will made by the person should also be registered.</li></ol></p><h3>Why is it recommended to register a Will?</h3><p>It is true that not registering a will doesn’t mean the will isn’t genuine. The unregistered will doesn’t stop any legal heir to fight for the same. Then why is it recommended to register a will? The government does not consider a will has the only final legal document for distributing any deceased person’s estate or other assets. After the will owner’s demise, the executor named in the will applies for the testamentary proceedings in the civil court. They must apply for the same within two years from the death of the will owner. The executor must also submit a proof confirming will testator’s death. They should also confirm that this the last will and it is a valid testament of the deceased. The court issues a notice to the testator’s legal heirs to file objections if any to the granting of probate or citation publication in the local newspaper. The court also confirms if the will submitted is the actual final will of the deceased person. It also confirms whether the testator duly executed and attested the will according to the law. Also, it collects proof on whether the testator was of sound mind when they created a will. Finally, the court issues a letter of probate or a letter of administration, mentioning the necessary points are satisfied. One can challenge the will by claiming the testator was mentally unsound while making the will. Also can claim that the will was altered after being signed. During such times, a registered will helps the court by being a piece of legal evidence against these allegations. One cannot destroy, steal, mutilate or tamper with the registered will. Hence, the court will not doubt the will’s authenticity. This helps the asset distribution process to move peacefully without chaos or confusion.</p>",

The details will be given from the entries available in the register available with the sub-registrar.</p><h3>What are the Different Types of Encumbrance Certificate?</h3><p>The Encumbrance Certificate is usually issued in 2 forms – Form 15 & Form 16.</p><p><ol><li>Form 15 – The ‘Form 15’ is issued when the property has any encumbrance during the said period. It includes information such as the nature of the encumbrance such as gift, partition, lease and loan, the parties involved, the registered number of the document and other details in a date-wise manner</li><li>Form 16 – The ‘Form 16’ or ‘Nil Encumbrance Certificate (NEC)‘ is issued when the property does not have any encumbrance during the said period. Note: While an Encumbrance Certificate contains all transaction details related to a property, however, it may not be enough to prove the ownership of the property. Therefore, it is wise for buyers to obtain a Possession Certificate along with an EC.</li></ol></p><h3>How Long Does it Take to Get an Encumbrance Certificate?</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, the process to obtain an EC differs from one place to another. If you apply for an EC in person at a Sub-Registrar’s Office, you will get the certificate within 15 to 30 days. However, if you apply for an EC online, you will get it faster. Online applications usually take 2 to 3 working days to be processed.</p><h3>What is Nil Encumbrance Certificate?</h3><p>When you apply for an Encumbrance Certificate, you will be asked to specify the period for which you need the information. If there are no charges placed on the property during the requested period, a “Nil Encumbrance Certificate” will be issued. This means that no lender has placed a lien on the property during that period.</p><h3>What are the Documents Required to Get an Encumbrance Certificate?</h3><p>Some of the documents that you may require when applying for an Encumbrance Certificate are:</p><p><ul><li>Applicant’s proof of address.</li><li>Property registration document.</li><li>Property details and its title deed details.</li><li>The property sale deed/gift deed/partition deed/release deed if a deed has been executed previously.</li><li>The deed number upon registration containing the date and book number along with the signature of the applicant.</li></ul></p>",

      "<h3>What is Patta/Chitta/Adangal?</h3><p>A Patta is a revenue record of a piece of land, while a Chitta contains details about the area, size, ownership of the property. Since 2015, both records have been merged into a single document called Patta Chitta. In order to establish your right over a property, you must have enough documented proof. In Tamil Nadu, a ‘Patta’ is all the evidence you need, to prove your legal right over a property. The Tamil Nadu state government launched the Tamil Nadu Patta Chitta Land Record for citizens of Tamil Nadu, who can now access digitised land records. This service comes under the revenue department.</p><h3>Patta</h3><p>A Patta is a revenue record of a piece of land. It is issued by the government and is also known as the Record of Rights (ROR). The Patta includes the Patta number, name of the district, taluk and village, owner’s name, survey number and subdivision, wetland/dryland, area of land and tax details.</p><h3>Chitta</h3><p>This land revenue document contains details about the area, size, ownership of the property. These details are maintained by the Village Administration Officer and the nature of land- whether dry or wetland is mentioned. Starting 2015, both these documents have been merged and are available as one with all the relevant information in the Patta.</p><h3>Details on the Patta Chitta document</h3><p>You can get the following information in the Patta Chitta document:</p><p><ul><li>Name of the Owner</li><li>Sub-division and survey number</li><li>Quantity of Patta</li><li>Name of the district, village and taluk of the owner</li><li>Area or dimensions of the land</li><li>Tax details of the owner</li><li>Dry land or wetland details</li><li>Chitta land ownership</li></ul></p><h3>Nature of land</h3><p><b>Nanjai: </b>In short, it is a wetland – it could be a lake, river, canal or water bodies.</p><p><b>Punjai: </b>Punjai is dry land. It has low water reservoirs and depends on small sources such as well, borewells, etc.</p><h3>Documents required to apply for patta chitta online</h3><p>The following documents are required, if you are applying for the Patta Chitta. Keep them handy. These include:</p><p><ul><li>The original sale deed is required, as well as a photocopy of this deed, which will be verified. These need to be submitted in the tehsildar’s office.</li><li>Any proof of possession of the property. This includes property tax payment receipt, electricity bill or even the encumbrance certificate. These documents establish your claim and legal possession over the property.</li></ul></p><h3>How to transfer Patta Chitta?</h3><p>You must apply for the transfer of Patta. The application needs to be submitted in the respective tehsildar’s office. Do carry photocopies and original documents of the sale deed, tax receipts, electricity bill and encumbrance certificate, when applying for transfer of Patta Chitta. The application may be accepted or rejected, on the basis of the study that the concerned department does. Fees charged for Patta Chitta transfer is Rs 100 only.</p><h3>Step by step process to change your name in Patta</h3><p>Note that you cannot change the name on the Patta online. However, you can do it by making a physical visit.</p><p><ul><li>Visit the village administration office.</li><li>Ask for changes in the patta transfer form provided to you.</li><li>Keep handy the sale deed, tax receipts, electricity bill and encumbrance certificate, as you may need to show these.</li><li>Fill the form and submit the signed form, with the documents.</li></ul></p><p>It may take up to 30 days for changes to reflect and a new Patta to be issued.</p><h3>Other requirements of Patta Chitta</h3><p>To be eligible for various economic developmental schemes, the Tamil Nadu government may ask you for your documents which include, proof of residence, community certificate with number, details like family’s annual income, family card, ration card, GST number and project report, along with patta/chitta (for buying land and its development). Therefore, keep these handy.</p><h3>Is Patta Chitta, adangal available across Tamil Nadu?</h3><p>Tamil Nadu land records are available for 27 out of 32 districts in the state, while for the rest, the digitisation process is still ongoing. Districts where the patta, chitta and adangal are available, include Ariyalur, Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Dharmapuri, Dindigul, Erode, Kancheepuram, Kanyakumari, Karur, Krishnagiri, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Namakkal, Nilgiris, Perambalur, Pudukottai, Ramanathapuram, Salem, Sivagangai, Thanjavur, Thoothukkudi, Tirunelveli, Tiruppur, Tiruvannamalai, Vellore, Villupuram and Virudhunagar.</p><h3>Beware of fake Patta Chitta</h3><p>In 2018, Tamil Nadu’s Registration Department came up with the idea to phase out paper-based Pattas and introduce geo information system (GIS) based registration in which land would be marked using geo coordinates. The facility was added in an updated version of the Simplified and Transparent Administration of Registration (STAR 2.0). Apart from paperwork being reduced drastically, it addressed the problem of fake Pattas. In Tamil Nadu, fake Patta Chitta adangals have been a problem, with cases cropping up every now and then. The authorities are taking steps to prevent instances of use of fake Pattas. An aggrieved person can file a declaratory petition under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act,1963 before the relevant court.</p>",

      "<h3>DTCP Approval</h3><p>The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and Directorate of Town and Country Planning (DTCP) are the nodal agencies responsible for issuing land layout approvals in Tamil Nadu. The jurisdiction of the CMDA is confined to Chennai and its peripheral areas. DTCP jurisdictions are confined to all other parts of the State. Approval for layouts up to 10 acres (increased from 5 acres) is accorded by the Local Planning Authority (LPA), a sub-committee of the DTCP. Layout approvals over 10 acres are sanctioned by the head office of the DTCP in Chennai. There is no adequate legal awareness among the general public with respect to Panchayat layouts. In fact, there is no terminology called ‘Panchayat Approval’ as only LPA’s and the DTCP have the authority to accord layout sanctions.

This in fact helps to form a better course of action for the future. People will vouch for a CMDA approved plot considering that it is legal. Though CMDA Approval process is a bit stringent compared to DTCP, the value of CMDA Plots seem to have a high appreciation in the future as it comes under the city limits.

      "<h3>What is Fencing?</h3><p>A fence is a structure that encloses an area, typically outdoors, and is usually constructed from posts that are connected by boards, wire, rails or netting. A fence differs from a wall in not having a solid foundation along its whole length.</p><h3>Types of Fencing?</h3><p><ul><li>Garden Fencing.</li><li>Security Fences.</li><li>Agri Fencing.</li><li>Precast Concrete Fence.</li><li>Perimeter fencing.</li></ul></p><h3>Reasons You Need A Fence Around Your Property</h3><p><p>If you have been trying to decide on whether to install a fence on your property, or not there will have been a lot of questions posed as to why you should invest in fencing. There are many reasons why you should install a fence on or around your property and although each property is different to the next, fencing is a decision that will not only improve security but improve your home’s value. Here are some of the more important reasons for installing a quality fence around your property.</p><h6>Security and Safety</h6><p>The most important reason for installing fencing on your property is security. Fencing protects your valuables and more importantly protects you and your family. A fence acts as a deterrent for trespassers and intruders and keeps unwanted wild animals off your property as well.</p><h6>Boundaries</h6><p>Without fencing it can be hard to know where your property lines are and installing fencing will help to define the correct boundaries between your neighbor’s land and your own. Although you may get along well with your neighbors now, this might not always be the case, and often property lines can play a part in neighborly disputes. Fences are the perfect way to prevent this.</p><h6>Privacy</h6><p>Privacy is also one of the most common reasons for installing a fence on your property. Fences can separate your home from the outside world, and when it comes to privacy, knowing there are no prying eyes of strangers or neighbors watching your family offers freedom from worry. Privacy can be easily reached with the use of high fencing or combining fences with trees and shrubs.</p><h6>Aesthetics</h6><p>Fences are a great way to increase the curb appeal of your home. There are many options available for fencing that can increase the aesthetic appeal of your home, as well as increasing the value. Choosing a fence that suits your home is as important as ensuring it features the right aspects of security and privacy. Your fence should be durable and should match your home in color themes and style.</p><h6>Resale</h6><p>A quality fence with great curb appeal, excellent security and privacy aspects will improve the value of your home, and if you are looking to sell, it can substantially increase the sale price. New home owners look for quality fencing when searching for homes, and as security and privacy are usually high on buyer’s lists your new fence is a great investment that will get return.</p></p>",
